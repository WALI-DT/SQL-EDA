# SQL-EDA
**Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Layoffs**

**Overview:**
This project analyzes global layoff trends using SQL to extract meaningful insights from a dataset containing detailed layoff data. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns and uncovering key metrics related to layoffs across various industries, locations, and time periods. The project is structured to provide insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.

The SQL code used for the analysis is contained in the **`World_Layoffs_EDA.sql`** file, and the dataset is provided in the **`World_Layoffs_Data.csv`** file. Together, these resources offer a comprehensive view of the analysis process and findings.

**Key Insights Explored:**
1. **Percentage of Layoffs:** Calculated the proportion of employees laid off relative to the total workforce.
2. **Companies with 100% Layoffs:** Identified organizations where all employees were laid off.
3. **Company Size Based on Layoffs:** Categorized companies by the ratio of layoffs to total employees.
4. **Largest Single Layoff Event:** Determined the company with the most significant layoff at a single instance.
5. **Company with the Largest Total Layoffs:** Analyzed cumulative layoffs to identify companies most affected.
6. **Grouped Layoff Trends:** Summarized total layoffs by attributes such as location, country, year, industry, and company funding stage (e.g., Series A, Series B).
7. **Yearly Layoff Trends:** Highlighted the years with the highest number of layoffs.
8. **Rolling Totals with CTE:** Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to compute rolling totals of layoffs for trend analysis.

**Project Files:**
- **`World_Layoffs_EDA.sql`**: Contains all SQL queries used for the analysis, structured for clarity and reusability.
- **`World_Layoffs_Data.csv`**: The dataset used for the analysis, comprising details on layoffs, company attributes, and timelines.

**Purpose:**
This project aims to provide actionable insights into global layoff patterns, helping businesses, policymakers, and researchers understand the dynamics of workforce reductions. Whether you're a technical professional exploring SQL techniques or a non-technical stakeholder interested in layoff trends, this project offers valuable perspectives.
